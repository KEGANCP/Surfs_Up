# Surfs_Up - "Surf n Shake" Venture, Oahu, Hawaii
-----
### Project Overview
With plans to return Hawaii, in hopes to live there forever, I've finally conceptualize a busines plan to open a Surf & Ice Cream shop in Oahu, Hawaii. I plan to use my savings to invest, but will require the backing of other investers. I have reached out to a potential investor, W. Avy, who is willing to invest, but first requests weather data for Oahu to ensure this is an ideal location for this venture.

Utilizing raw weather data for a 12 month period, I was able to retrieve the below output showing percepitation in Oahu in a digestible visual plot.

In efforts to allow data to appear immediately when presenting to my investors, I utilized VS code & Flask to generate a the pertinent data via a web browser. Example of this code is shown below:

At last, when presenting my findings to W. Avy, he has asked to compare weather data between June and December. Utilizing Python and the prior data set, I was able to obtain the following 2 data tables.
