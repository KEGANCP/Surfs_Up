# Surfs_Up - "Surf n Shake" Venture, Oahu, Hawaii
-----
### Project Overview
With plans to return Hawaii, in hopes to live there forever, I've finally conceptualize a busines plan to open a Surf & Ice Cream shop in Oahu, Hawaii. I plan to use my savings to invest, but will require the backing of other investers. I have reached out to a potential investor, W. Avy, who is willing to invest, but first requests weather data for Oahu to ensure this is an ideal location for this venture.
