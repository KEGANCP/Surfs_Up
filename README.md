# Surfs_Up - "Surf n Shake" Venture - Oahu, Hawaii
-----
### Project Overview
With plans to return to Hawaii, in hopes to live there forever, I've finally conceptualize a busines plan to open a Surf & Ice Cream shop in Oahu, Hawaii. I plan to use my savings to invest, but will require the backing of other investers. I have reached out to a potential investor, W. Avy, who is willing to invest, but first requests weather data for Oahu to ensure this is an ideal location for this venture.

### Analysis Results
Utilizing raw weather data for a 12 month period, I was able to retrieve the below output showing percepitation in Oahu in a digestible visual plot.

In efforts to allow data to appear immediately when presenting to my investors, I utilized VS code & Flask to generate a the pertinent data via a web browser. Example of this code is shown below:

At last, when presenting my findings to W. Avy, he has asked to compare weather data between June and December. Utilizing Python and the prior data set, I was able to obtain the following 2 data tables.
Reviewing the below 2 tables we can conclude the following:
- The average overall temperature only varies by less than 4 degress.
- Our low in December is 8 degress lower than June's lowest.
- Our max temperature between the two only vary by 2 degrees.

### Project Summary
This analysis provided a good outlook, and helped confirm Oahu as a prime candidate for the Surf n Shake venture. However, considering the investment required to make this a reality, I would recommend further research before making a final decision.  I would recommend adding percipitation in a similar breakdown for June and December. I would also recommend adding additional stations in our data and research for a wider range of data. It would also be beneficial to compare several years of this data to ensure the trend holds true through-out.
